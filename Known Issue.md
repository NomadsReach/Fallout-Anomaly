1. When clicking "play," the main menu might experience a delay as scripts load. Please be patient and allow it to load.

2. Upon hitting "play," your game may take a few minutes to load into character creation. Simply let it load, and it will progress further. If you find yourself still stuck in the menu, try alt-tabbing out of the game and then back in. Afterward, press the "Esc" key in the menu, which should load you into the game.

3. After creating your character, your game will save and may temporarily appear to freeze. This happens because multiple scripts are loading simultaneously. Again, please be patient and wait for a few minutes at least, and it will catch up and resume smoothly.

4. If you are taking random rads it's from this mod: [Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/67336) - You can adjust as you please in MCM

* Why is my character coughing so much? (This is not a bug)

* The coughing can be a multitude of things. Firstly you could adjust the mcm settings called coughing, if you have your flashlight on a lot that produces rads after a while. Verify you have no negative effects in your pip-boy as well

* Further info thanks to user @detoxer 

* "I read something about the coughing and advanced needs.  After you switch on advanced needs the coughing becomes constant, but if you take some antibiotics it goes back to the normal threshold."
