1. **Main Menu Delay Issue:**
   - When clicking "play," the main menu might experience a delay as scripts load. Please be patient and allow it to load. - This is mostly dependent on your system, and those with more powerful systems may not have this issue.

   - Upon hitting "play," your game may take a few minutes to load into character creation. Simply let it load, and it will progress further. 

    - If you find yourself still stuck in the menu, try alt-tabbing out of the game and then back in. Afterward, press the "Esc" key in the menu, 
      which should load you into the game.

2. After creating your character, your game will save and may temporarily appear to freeze. This happens because multiple scripts are loading simultaneously. Again, please be patient and wait for a few minutes at least, and it will catch up and resume smoothly.

3. **Character Creation Freeze:**
   - After creating your character, your game will save and may temporarily appear to freeze. This happens because multiple scripts are loading simultaneously. Please be patient and wait for a few minutes at least, and it will catch up and resume smoothly.

4. **Random Radiation Issue:**
   - If you are taking random rads it's from this mod: [Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/67336) - You can adjust as you please in MCM.

5. **Installation Failed Issue:**
   - For users experiencing the following installation failed issue when getting a fresh installation from wabbajack: Please download this Mod organizer 2 file [here](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases/download/v2.4.4/Mod.Organizer-2.4.4.7z) and put it into your \Fallout Anomaly\downloads folder that you specified in the wabbajack installer and continue with the installation, making sure you've checked "overwrite installation."

6. **Excessive Character Coughing:**
   - Why is my character coughing so much? (This is not a bug)
     - The coughing can be a multitude of things. Firstly you could adjust the MCM settings called coughing. If you have your flashlight on a lot that produces rads after a while. Verify you have no negative effects in your pip-boy as well.
     - Further info thanks to user @detoxer: "I read something about the coughing and advanced needs. After you switch on advanced needs the coughing becomes constant, but if you take some antibiotics it goes back to the normal threshold."

7. **Disabling Black Bars:**
   - To disable the black bars at the top & bottom of the screen: open the ENB menu in-game by pressing Shift + Enter. Go to the ENBEffectPostPass section and uncheck the 'Enable letterbox bars' option.

8. **Disabling Character Dialogue Mods:**
   - If you do not like your character not talking, disable these mods:

10. **ENBS** 

    - Some ENBs cause the Pip-Boy to be blurry. This is usually the fault of how the enb preset was designed. You can change to a different one if it bothers you.
    
    -  ENB ISSUE: http://enbdev.com/mod_fallout4_v0496.htm. You must delete the former ENB file before placing the new one. You must delete the META file as well! These will both be located in the downloads folder where you are downloading the list to. You must search for the 
       download name and delete the related files. DOWNLOAD: [LINK](http://enbdev.com/mod_fallout4_v0496.htm.)

11. **Other misc issues.**

    - Falling through the vault at the start is most likely caused by uneducated shooter - Disable it until you are out of that area. Quote from SKK Fast Start: (7) If you are falling through the elevator mesh you may have a naughty scrapping mod which messes with object collision or something which messes with player collision (like uneducated shooter). This mod never has and never will modify ANY game objects so save everyone time and dont bother pointing at it.
   
    - Some NPCs may not use a weapon. This is usaully caused by quest mods in when the mod author uses a dummy nif file. The issue occurs when modding weapons are put in that replace these vanilla weapons. If you encounter this please report it. American Rising is one of these mods.
   
    - Programs like medal (recording software) or anything that adds an overlay can conflict with the ENBS, or other DLL hooked mods. If you are crashing right at the launch of game or at the main menu this can be one of the main causes.
