1. **Main Menu Delay Issue:**
   - When clicking "play," the main menu might experience a delay as scripts load. Please be patient and allow it to load. If you are stuck behind a black loading screen after a few minutes just tap enter a few times. This is an old game bug.

2. **Character Creation Freeze:**
   - After creating your character, your game will save and may temporarily appear to freeze. This happens because multiple scripts are loading simultaneously. Please be patient and wait for a few minutes at least, and it will catch up and resume smoothly.

3. **Random Radiation Issue:**
   - If you are taking random rads it's from this mod: [Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/67336) - You can adjust as you please in MCM.

4. **Installation Failed Issue:**
   - For users experiencing the following installation failed issue when getting a fresh installation from wabbajack: Please download this Mod organizer 2 file [here](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases/download/v2.4.4/Mod.Organizer-2.4.4.7z) and put it into your \Fallout Anomaly\downloads folder that you specified in the wabbajack installer and continue with the installation, making sure you've checked "overwrite installation."

5. **Excessive Character Coughing:**
   - Why is my character coughing so much? (This is not a bug)
     - The coughing can be a multitude of things. Firstly you could adjust the MCM settings called coughing. If you have your flashlight on a lot that produces rads after a while. Verify you have no negative effects in your pip-boy as well.
     - Further info thanks to user @detoxer: "I read something about the coughing and advanced needs. After you switch on advanced needs the coughing becomes constant, but if you take some antibiotics it goes back to the normal threshold."

6. **Disabling Black Bars:**
   - To disable the black bars at the top & bottom of the screen: open the ENB menu in-game by pressing Shift + Enter. Go to the ENBEffectPostPass section and uncheck the 'Enable letterbox bars' option.

7. **Disabling Character Dialogue Mods:**
   - If you do not like your character not talking, disable these mods:
