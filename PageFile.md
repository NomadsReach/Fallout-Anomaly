Here‚Äôs a revised and polished version of your **Pagefile Configuration** guide for *Fallout Anomaly*. It keeps your structure but improves clarity, grammar, and formatting consistency:

##  Pagefile Configuration

If you're running *Fallout Anomaly* on a system with **16 GB of RAM or less**, setting a custom **pagefile** on the same drive as the game can dramatically improve stability and reduce crashes caused by memory limitations‚Äîespecially when using large modlists.

To simplify the process, we've created an automated batch script that does it for you.

2. **Right-click** the downloaded file and select **‚ÄúRun as Administrator.‚Äù**

3. When prompted, **enter the drive letter** where *Fallout Anomaly* is installed.

4. The script will automatically calculate and apply a recommended pagefile size based on your system‚Äôs RAM.

5. **Type `Y` and press Enter** to restart your computer and apply the changes.

Properly configuring your pagefile helps prevent crashes and improves performance on lower-RAM systems running heavily modded builds of *Fallout Anomaly*.

9. Choose **Custom size**, and set both values to:
   - **Initial size (MB):** `20480` (20 GB) for 16 GB RAM  
   - **Maximum size (MB):** `20480`  
   - For 32 GB RAM, use `40960` for both fields

### üí° Why This Matters

Large modlists can push *Fallout 4* beyond its memory limits, especially on systems with 16 GB or less RAM. Setting a custom pagefile helps prevent memory-related crashes and improves overall game stability.
