## Pagefile Configuration

To improve overall system stabilityâ€”especially if you're running with **16 GB of RAM or less**â€”we highly recommend setting a custom **pagefile** on the same drive where *Fallout Anomaly* is installed. This adjustment helps prevent crashes and performance drops caused by memory limitations in heavily modded environments.

Weâ€™ve created a simple batch file that automates this process for you.
