## Pagefile Config


To enhance system stability, especially if you're operating with limited RAM (such as 16 GB), it's advisable to configure the page file system for the drive where you're running Fallout Anomaly. Follow these steps:

1. Press the Windows key and R key simultaneously to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type `sysdm.cpl` and hit Enter. This command opens the System Properties window.
3. In the System Properties window, navigate to the "Advanced" tab.
4. Under the "Performance" section, click on the "Settings" button. This will open the Performance Options window.
5. In the Performance Options window, go to the "Advanced" tab.
6. Under the "Virtual memory" section, click on the "Change" button. This will allow you to adjust the virtual memory settings.
7. Uncheck the box that says "Automatically manage paging file size for all drives" if it's checked.
8. Select the drive where Fallout Anomaly is installed.
9. Choose the option "Custom size" and specify the Initial size (MB) and Maximum size (MB) for the page file. The recommended size is typically 1.5 times your physical RAM size, but with only 16 GB of RAM, setting it to a fixed size around 20 GB (20480 MB) might be sufficient for stability. If you have 32gb you can set this to 40,000MB.
10. Click on the "Set" button, then click "OK" to confirm the changes.
11. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

By configuring the page file system in this manner, you can potentially improve system stability, particularly when running resource-intensive applications like Fallout Anomaly on a system with limited RAM.
