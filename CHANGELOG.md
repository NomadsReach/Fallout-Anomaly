**Content and Quests:**

---

**Anything removed from this section is either severely outdated, buggy, or does not align with our vision for Fallout Anomaly. For instance, Thuggysmurf's mods fall into this category. (nothing against him) These mods are highly NSFW (Not Safe For Work), lore-breaking, or simply do not fit our vision. Examples include Outcast & Remnants, Fusion City, and a couple of his others listed below. The team hopes you understand our choice but we are always open for your input. ❤️**
