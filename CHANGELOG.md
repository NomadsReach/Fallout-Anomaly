**Added Mods:**

1. Disable Companion Collision
2. Heather Casdin CBBE Bodyslide with Physics Support
3. RobCo - Smarter Companions
4. Patches for Lively's Keywords Resource and Whisper's Standalone Workbenches

**Tweaks & Updates:**

1. Consolidated over 30GB of loose files into a BA2 archive, reducing total install size.
2. Reduced redundant armor mods in preparation for WARS/PEACE. Several armors all doing the same or looking exactly the same. The more unique ones are still in.
3. Decreased the number of weapon mods, considering the inclusion of new weapons with WARS. WARS adds a handful of weapons already patched.
4. Transitioned LevelList management to RobCo for better control and stability, avoiding issues with injector scripts.
5. Previs issues still being resolved. Have to patch around the list and resolve conflicts.
6. Brown/Black face bug still being looked into. Engine bug issue. Very common known issue with Fallout 4.

**QA:**

Q: Why not patch everything with WARS and PEACE?
A: We're working on it, but it's time-consuming. We're already planning for version 0.5 and gradually integrating patches. Adding more weapons and armor will take time but won't disrupt gameplay significantly.

Q: When is version 0.5 coming?
A: Anticipated release in 2024. Work on 0.5 has begun, and we'll transition from 0.4.9 once satisfied with its stability.
