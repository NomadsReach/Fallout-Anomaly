# Behind the Scenes â€“ What Weâ€™re Working On

The next version of *Fallout Anomaly* isnâ€™t just another update â€” itâ€™s a complete rebuild.  
Weâ€™ve taken a step back to examine every system, mechanic, and design choice. What weâ€™re building now is a total overhaul designed to be more immersive, more balanced, and far more stable than anything weâ€™ve released before.

This is not a patch. Itâ€™s a new foundation â€” a full reimagining of what Anomaly can be.

We understand many of you have been frustrated with bugs, crashes, or inconsistent features.  
Weâ€™ve felt that frustration too. In the past, our approach was to release large beta builds and continue patching them as new issues came to light. And while those builds represented a ton of hard work, they were still limited by the size of our testing team â€” usually fewer than ten people â€” compared to the 5,000+ of you who were jumping into the list on release.

When bugs slip through and patches pile up, the entire experience suffers. It becomes messy, unstable, and harder to maintain â€” for us and for you.

So weâ€™re doing it differently this time.

Instead of rushing out another beta, weâ€™re allowing ourselves the time and space to **test thoroughly**, **refactor carefully**, and **build confidently**.  
It means a longer wait, but it also means that when you finally get your hands on the next version of Anomaly, it will be cleaner, tighter, and more refined than anything weâ€™ve delivered before.

## Core Gameplay Systems

Weâ€™re rebuilding fundamental systems like health, healing, injury mechanics, and damage scaling to feel more grounded, consistent, and reactive.  
Survival will matter again â€” and every decision in combat will carry more weight.

Combat will still be brutal, like you're used to, but now itâ€™ll feel more fair. Damage values will make sense. Healing will be slower and more tactical.  
Youâ€™ll need to think, react, and adapt â€” not just tank through fights.

And yes â€” we hear you. Those **Tyrants**? Theyâ€™re a bit much. We're working on getting them out of the Commonwealth and restoring balance to encounters across the board.

---

## Settlements & Crafting

The entire crafting and settlement experience is being rebuilt.  
Recipes, workbenches, upgrades, and utility items are being completely restructured.  
Expect tighter progression, cleaner categories, and a stronger connection between scavenging, crafting, and survival.

Weâ€™re designing a system that rewards planning and exploration â€” not just hoarding materials.

---

## Enemy Factions & Gear Logic

Weâ€™re introducing a custom **Faction Framework** that gives every faction and class of NPC their own unique gear.

- No more generic, randomized weapons or armor.
- Raiders will feel like scavengers.
- Elite units will be properly equipped.
- Faction identity will be clearer than ever before.

This framework gives us full control over how each faction looks, fights, and scales â€” and makes every encounter more believable and satisfying.

---

## Loot Overhaul

Weâ€™re rebuilding loot tables from the ground up.

- Every container, corpse, and encounter is being reviewed and rebalanced.
- Rare gear will truly be rare.
- Junk will be reduced.
- Everything you find will have purpose.

Whether itâ€™s a scavengerâ€™s backpack or a boss chest at the end of a dungeon, loot will feel earned â€” not random.

---

## Quest Content & Progression

Weâ€™re adding new lore-friendly quests and developing our own custom content to enhance storytelling, faction dynamics, and player choice.

- Faction paths will go deeper.
- Side content will expand.
- Progression will feel more personal and reactive to your decisions.

---

## Framework & Testing Infrastructure

Development has fully transitioned into a **modular GitHub framework**, allowing us to:

- Isolate features for easier testing
- Track bugs more efficiently
- Scale patching and development cleanly

This new system is already in use in the private alpha and is helping us move faster and more safely than ever before.

---

## A New Schematic System

Weâ€™re building a brand-new **schematic-based crafting system** â€” something never done at this level in Fallout 4.

- Nearly every weapon, armor set, and major item will be locked behind schematics.
- Some schematics will be found in the world.
- Others will be built from parts, earned through progression, or purchased from select vendors.

This adds a whole new layer of purpose to scavenging and exploration.  
Crafting becomes progression â€” not just clicking through a menu. Every item you unlock will feel like a milestone.

# Looking Ahead â€“ Public Build Notes *(This is the version you're playing right now)*

As we prepare for the next public release, here are key changes under consideration:

- **Immersive Hunting Overhaul** will be removed.  
  It hasnâ€™t been updated in years, causes instability, and no longer fits our long-term goals.

- **First Aid mods** will be replaced by the latest version of **MAIM**,  
  offering better integration, realism, and stability with our new injury systems.

- **BLD** will be replaced with **True Damage** for improved balance and compatibility.

- **Damn Apocalypse** and **IRA (Internal Radiation Accumulation)** may be removed.  
  While immersive on paper, theyâ€™ve introduced more issues than benefits.

- A new **Alternate Start mod** is being introduced.  
  It's already active in the beta and provides a cleaner, more modular character intro.

**Note:** These changes **will require a new save** when the next version is released.

### ðŸ“… Release Timeline

- The next **public update** (maintenance patch with cleanup and early groundwork) is expected within **1â€“2 weeks**.
- The full **next major version** of Fallout Anomaly â€” featuring the complete rebuild, new systems, schematic crafting, and full faction framework â€” is currently in development and is estimated to release in **6â€“12 months**, depending on testing, implementation, and iteration.

Weâ€™ll keep this timeline updated as development progresses. Thanks for your patience and support.

## Final Thoughts

Weâ€™re incredibly proud of the work happening behind the scenes, and weâ€™re grateful to this community for sticking with us.

This rebuild is about doing things right â€” no shortcuts, no rushed releases, no endless patch cycles.

Weâ€™re building something more stable, more immersive, and more worth your time.  
And when itâ€™s ready â€” youâ€™ll feel the difference.

â€” *The Fallout Anomaly Dev Team*
