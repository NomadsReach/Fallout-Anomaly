  ### <strong><ins>About</strong></ins>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Background</strong></summary>
    
  * The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, developed by Ukrainian game studio GSC Game World, has long been hailed for its masterful blend of survival horror, open-world exploration, and atmospheric storytelling. Set in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, these games create a sense of dread and unease, making players question their every step in the desolate wasteland. Fallout 4, on the other hand, is renowned for its vast open world and role-playing elements, set in a retro-futuristic post-apocalyptic America.
  
  * We recognized the opportunity to combine the strengths of both worlds. Drawing inspiration from the bleak and perilous world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and leveraging the expansive sandbox of Fallout 4, we embarked on a mission to create a modlist that would redefine the Fallout experience. The result is a remarkable fusion of the two franchises, offering a unique blend of survival, exploration, and storytelling.
  
  <ins>To put it simply, we plan to combine the two.</ins>

<ins><strong>Wabbajack Installation Guide for Fallout Anomaly</ins><strong>

---

To begin, ensure that Wabbajack is installed on your system. It's crucial to install it in a location separate from your typical profile folder to avoid errors. You can download Wabbajack from the following link: [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/). For example, you might choose to install it in C:\Wabbajack.

Once Wabbajack is successfully installed, create a new folder dedicated to Fallout Anomaly. For instance, you can create a folder at C:\Fallout Anomaly.

The next step involves downloading the mod list. You have two options to accomplish this:

1. **Direct Download:** Visit our Nexus page to download the mod list directly.

2. **Wabbajack GUI:** Alternatively, within the Wabbajack GUI, select Fallout 4, navigate to the "Unofficial" section, and then locate Fallout Anomaly. Click on the play button to initiate the download.

3. After completing either of the above steps, locate the Fallout Anomaly folder you created earlier. This folder will serve as the "Modlist installation location.

4. Click the "Go" button within Wabbajack to begin the download and installation process. Wabbajack will now proceed to install Fallout Anomaly according to the specified mod list.
