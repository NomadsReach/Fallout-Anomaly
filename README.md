# What is Fallout Anomaly?

The **S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series**, developed by Ukrainian game studio **GSC Game World**, is known for its blend of survival horror, open-world exploration, and atmospheric storytelling. Fallout 4, on the other hand, is renowned for its vast open world and role-playing elements, set in a retro-futuristic post-apocalyptic America.

Recognizing the opportunity to combine both worlds, we created a modlist blending the bleak world of **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** with the sandbox of **Fallout 4**, offering a unique blend of survival, exploration, and storytelling.

## Disclaimer:

- **Beta Stages:**  
  Fallout Anomaly is currently in **beta**, meaning changes and evolution are inevitable. Updates may require starting a new save. If you're not ready for this, we recommend waiting until Anomaly is out of beta. However, we‚Äôre proud to have a community of nearly **2,000 members** who understand and embrace this process.  

- **Steam Version Only:**  
  At this time, **only the Steam version** of Fallout 4 is supported. Ensure your game is updated to version **1.10.980.0** for compatibility with the Wabbajack downgrade process.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Update Requirement ‚ö†Ô∏è

### üö® **YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO UPDATE FALLOUT 4 TO THE NEXT-GEN VERSION. THIS ISN'T UP FOR DEBATE; IT'S MANDATORY.** üö®


## Getting Started - You must go through each step!

<details>
  <summary>STEP 1: Getting Started</summary>
 
# Hardware:

- CPU: Go for a modern CPU with at least 6 cores and a speed of 3GHz.

- RAM: Start with 16GB, but 32GB is better.

- Video Card: Get one with at least 6GB of memory, but 8GB is ideal.

- OS: Use Windows 10/11 (64-bit) and make sure all drivers are up to date.

- Free Disk Space: You'll require a minimum of 350GB of storage, with an SSD being mandatory. Using a hard disk drive (HDD) is not an option. Do not complain if you have long loading because you're using a HDD. If your internet is quick, consider clearing out the download folder to save space.

By opting for Nexus Premium, you'll enjoy uncapped download speeds and won't have to manually approve each download. This is a restriction from the Nexus website itself and is not a limitation imposed by Fallout Anomaly.

# Problems with Wabbajack

- **Could not download MOD:** If certain mods fail to download, You can manually download them from their source and place the archived folder in the downloads folder of where your Wabbajack is downloading to. At times nexus mods may be down. You can check if this is the case by following this link: [NEXUS MODS STATUS](https://nexusmods.statuspage.io/)
- **Mod is not a whitelisted download:** This error can occur when the modlist is updated or the mod link no longer works. Check for updates and wait for a new release if necessary. If you get this error please notify us on discord.
- **Missing Game Files:** More than likely you have not updated your game to the next gen version. You must do this.
- **Wabbajack could not find my game folder:** Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. Ensure you own the game on Steam and follow the pre-installation steps accordingly.

  <summary>STEP 3: Launching Fallout Anomaly</summary>
  
## Launching the Game

Upon launching **Mod Organizer 2 (MO2)**, you might initially find the interface a bit complex. However, we've simplified the process for ease of use. To launch Fallout Anomaly:

1. In the **top-right corner** of the MO2 interface, find the option labeled **"Launch Fallout Anomaly"** and click it to start the game.

### F4SE (Fallout 4 Script Extender)

**F4SE** is crucial for the functioning of most Fallout mods and is specifically required to launch Fallout Anomaly. When using MO2, **F4SE** will appear as **"Launch Fallout Anomaly"** in the mod launcher.

> **Important**:  
> <p style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">AT NO POINT SHOULD YOU EVER USE THE VANILLA GAME LAUNCHER! AT THIS POINT PLEASE ENSURE YOU SET ANTIVIRUS EXCEPTIONS FOR THE ENTIRE MOD ORGANIZER 2 FOLDER!</p>

# Crash Handling

If the game crashes while playing, a log will appear providing details about the crash. Please follow these steps:

1. **Save the log**: Make sure to save the crash log to an easily accessible location.
2. **Upload the log**: Upload the saved log to the bug report form [here](https://falloutanomaly.fillout.com/bugreports).
3. **Include the save file**: For further analysis, please include your most recent save file.
4. **Crash Tool**: If you are familiar with it, you can also run the crash tool to generate the log yourself.

---

# Changing Resolution

If your game resolution is not centered correctly, you can use **BethINI** to adjust it. Please **only change the resolution**, and do not alter any other settings.

### Steps to change resolution:
1. Open **BethINI** and select **Fallout 4** (do not change INI paths, as they are set correctly).
2. In the **Basic** tab, adjust the resolution.
3. Close **BethINI** and save your settings.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Adjust Antivirus Settings ‚ö†Ô∏è

To ensure smooth operation of your modding setup, **add exceptions** for the following files in your antivirus software:

1. **MO2.exe**: The Mod Organizer 2 executable.
2. **Fallout4.exe**: The main game executable.
3. **F4SE_Loader.exe**: Part of the Fallout 4 Script Extender (F4SE).

Additionally, **add the 'Stock Folder'** located within the **Mod Organizer 2** directory. This folder contains the `Fallout4.exe` file.

For **F4SE**, add an exception for the following path:  
`mods\F4SE & Other Root Folders\Root\f4se_loader.exe`.
