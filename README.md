<summary><h2><ins>STEP 1: Getting Started</ins></h2></summary>
  
 
# Hardware:

- CPU: Go for a modern CPU with at least 6 cores and a speed of 3GHz.

- RAM: Start with 16GB, but 32GB is better.

- Video Card: Get one with at least 6GB of memory, but 8GB is ideal.

- OS: Use Windows 10/11 (64-bit) and make sure all drivers are up to date.

- Free Disk Space: You'll require a minimum of 350GB of storage, with an SSD being mandatory. Using a hard disk drive (HDD) is not an option. Do not complain if you have long loading because you're using a HDD. If your internet is quick, consider clearing out the download folder to save space.

<summary><h2><ins>STEP 3: Launching Fallout Anomaly</ins></h2></summary>
 
  
## Launching the Game

Upon launching **Mod Organizer 2 (MO2)**, you might initially find the interface a bit complex. However, we've simplified the process for ease of use. To launch Fallout Anomaly:

1. In the **top-right corner** of the MO2 interface, find the option labeled **"Launch Fallout Anomaly"** and click it to start the game.

### F4SE (Fallout 4 Script Extender)

**F4SE** is crucial for the functioning of most Fallout mods and is specifically required to launch Fallout Anomaly. When using MO2, **F4SE** will appear as **"Launch Fallout Anomaly"** in the mod launcher.

> **Important**:  
> <p style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">AT NO POINT SHOULD YOU EVER USE THE VANILLA GAME LAUNCHER! AT THIS POINT PLEASE ENSURE YOU SET ANTIVIRUS EXCEPTIONS FOR THE ENTIRE MOD ORGANIZER 2 FOLDER!</p>

# Crash Handling

If the game crashes while playing, a log will appear providing details about the crash. Please follow these steps:

1. **Save the log**: Make sure to save the crash log to an easily accessible location.
2. **Upload the log**: Upload the saved log to the bug report form [here](https://falloutanomaly.fillout.com/bugreports).
3. **Include the save file**: For further analysis, please include your most recent save file.
4. **Crash Tool**: If you are familiar with it, you can also run the crash tool to generate the log yourself.

---

# Changing Resolution

If your game resolution is not centered correctly, you can use **BethINI** to adjust it. Please **only change the resolution**, and do not alter any other settings.

### Steps to change resolution:
1. Open **BethINI** and select **Fallout 4** (do not change INI paths, as they are set correctly).
2. In the **Basic** tab, adjust the resolution.
3. Close **BethINI** and save your settings.

---

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Adjust Antivirus Settings ‚ö†Ô∏è

To ensure smooth operation of your modding setup, **add exceptions** for the following files in your antivirus software:

1. **MO2.exe**: The Mod Organizer 2 executable.
2. **Fallout4.exe**: The main game executable.
3. **F4SE_Loader.exe**: Part of the Fallout 4 Script Extender (F4SE).

Additionally, **add the 'Stock Folder'** located within the **Mod Organizer 2** directory. This folder contains the `Fallout4.exe` file.

For **F4SE**, add an exception for the following path:  
`mods\F4SE & Other Root Folders\Root\f4se_loader.exe`.

# **Failure to do this will cause issues! Do not ignore these steps or we can not help you.**

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: APPLY THE MCM PRESET ‚ö†Ô∏è

  <summary><h2><ins>STEP 4: Known Issues</ins></h2></summary>

## Main Menu Delay

When clicking "Play," the main menu may experience a delay as scripts load. This delay varies based on your system's power; more powerful systems may not encounter this issue.

## Stuck in Menu

If you find yourself unable to progress from the first loading or main menu:

1. Please allow a few minutes for the game to fully load after it boots up. It may seem like the game is frozen during this time, but rest assured that it is simply processing the necessary assets.
2. Alt-tab out of the game & back in.
3. Press the "Esc" key in the menu to load into the game

## Post-Character Creation Freeze

After creating your character:
- Your game will save and may appear to freeze temporarily.
- This is due to multiple scripts loading simultaneously.
- Be patient and wait for a few minutes; the game will resume normally.

## Falling Through Vault Issue

If you're falling through the vault floor:
- This is likely due to the "Uneducated Shooter" mod.
- **Solution**: Only enable the "Uneducated Shooter" mod after leaving the vault.

## Known Crash Related Issues:

- Programs like medal (recording software) or anything that adds an overlay can conflict with the ENBS, or other DLL hooked mods. If you are crashing right at the launch of game or at the main menu this can be one of the main causes.

## Minor Issues

- Some NPCs may fail to use weapons even if they have ammunition in their inventory. If you experience this issue, please report it.. 

- Controller Support: Most mods currently do not include controller support. However, the base game offers controller support in vanilla Fallout. The Anomaly Team is working to provide controller support for these mods, with prior permission from the authors.

- **Robustness Skill**:
  - Increases carry weight as you level up, allowing more freedom to carry armor and junk.

- Backpacks provide an additional **100 CW capacity**.
- Use the "Open Backpack" aid item (found in the Aid section) to move items freely between inventory and backpack.

- Adds new traits for enhanced character customization.

---

# Combat Overhaul: SCOURGE

## Overview
- SCOURGE overhauls NPC stats by using scripts to randomly generate values, creating realistic variations in NPC strength. This ensures that enemies are no longer predictable while addressing issues with Fallout's vanilla scaling system.

### Key Features
- Implements **normal distribution** for stat allocation (e.g., health, damage resistance).
- Highly customizable via MCM:
  - Adjust stats for specific NPC races.
  - Exclude specific NPCs or individual stats from being affected.
- Optimized scripting to prevent lag or bloat.

### Example
- Deathclaws now have randomized health between 500‚Äì900, with an average of ~700.
- Infinite variations mean there are over **12 million possible combinations** for Deathclaw stats alone.

---

# Better Locational Damage (BLD)

- Equipment is what matters. Weapons/Modifications have been overhauled and you are now able to play a raider style character with pipe weapons only. All weapons are lethal. Getting a good balanced armor rating is key to survive as health does no longer scale with level. Use tactics and plan your actions, when breaching rooms and areas.
Many new features, like stagger, bleedings, stealth killmoves and more wait to be used!

## Combat Mechanics

### Enemy Categories
1. **Low Races**: Bloatfly, Bloodbug, Humans (no helmets), Ghouls (non-glowing), Radstags, Dogs.
2. **Medium Races**: Super Mutants, Mirelurks, helmeted Humans.
3. **High Races**: Yao Guai, Fog Crawlers, Anglers.
4. **Special Races**: Robots/Synths.

### Headshot Mechanics
- Effectiveness varies by race and weapon caliber:
  - Low races can be killed with most weapons via headshots.
  - Medium races require higher-caliber weapons (.308, .50) or shotguns at close range.
  - High races are resistant to headshots; use explosives or tactics instead.

### Pain System
- Introduces three pain levels: Minor, Moderate, Severe.
- Pain affects gameplay but can be treated with items like Med-X or alcohol.

---

# Deadeye Mod

## Overview
- Deadeye is a headshot-focused mod that adds tactical depth to combat. Players can choose between one-shot kills, helmet protection mechanics, or head destruction mechanics.

### Race Categories
1. Weak: Easily killed by most weapons (e.g., Bloatfly, Human).
2. Moderate: Requires moderate-caliber weapons or shotguns at close range (e.g., Super Mutants).
3. Strong: Requires high-caliber weapons (.50 rounds) (e.g., Yao Guai).
4. Powerful: Immune to headshots by default but can be enabled via configuration (e.g., Deathclaws).

---

# Munitions: Ammo Expansion Project

- Munitions is a lore-friendly and modular ammunition expansion project & framework that adds new ballistic, energy, and explosive ammunition types seamlessly into the vanilla sandbox. Unlike other ammo frameworks, Munitions gives players control over what ammo they do or don't want added to their game. Features high-quality custom textures and meshes.

## Features
- Adds new ballistic, energy, and explosive ammunition types.
- Modular design allows players to control which ammo types are added to their game.
- Lore-friendly additions inspired by previous Fallout games.

---

# Radiation System: Damn Apocalypse

## Mechanics
1. Introduces a dual radiation system:
   - **IRA (Ingested Radioactive Particles)**: Accumulated from food, water, weather hazards.
   - **RAD (Tissue Damage)**: Standard radiation damage from exposure.
2. Radiation poisoning mimics Acute Radiation Syndrome with progressive effects.
3. Weather-based radiation hazards require protective gear like gas masks or hazmat suits.

### New Items
- RadAway: Purges IRA and cures radiation poisoning.
- MutAway: Heals RADs directly.
- Rad-X: Increases IRA resistance.
- Pb-Jelly: Increases RAD resistance.

---

# Crafting System

## Overview
Crafting has been expanded with additional requirements:
1. Perk-based crafting for specialized items (e.g., Dogmeat-related perks for Dogmeat items).
2. Higher-tier armors require advanced crafting perks and materials like ballistic weave.
