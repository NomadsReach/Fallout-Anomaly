## Disclaimer:

- **Beta Stages:**  
  Fallout Anomaly is currently in **beta**, meaning changes and evolution are inevitable. Updates may require starting a new save. If you're not ready for this, we recommend waiting until Anomaly is out of beta. However, we’re proud to have a community of nearly **2,000 members** who understand and embrace this process.  

- **Steam Version Only:**  
  At this time, **only the Steam version** of Fallout 4 is supported. Ensure your game is updated to version **1.10.980.0** for compatibility with the Wabbajack downgrade process.

<summary><h2><ins>STEP 1: Getting Started</ins></h2></summary>

### Hardware Requirements

- **CPU**: Go for a modern CPU with at least 6 cores and a speed of 3GHz.
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum, but 32GB is ideal.
- **Video Card**: At least 6GB of memory, 8GB is recommended.
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit) with up-to-date drivers.
- **Free Disk Space**: A minimum of 350GB of storage is required, with an SSD being mandatory. Do not use a hard disk drive (HDD) as it will significantly affect load times.
- **Skills**: Basic computer usage knowledge, including maintenance and regular updates.
---
🚨 Do not install **Anomaly** directly on a root drive (e.g., `C:\Fallout Anomaly`). Instead, install it within a dedicated folder structure, such as: `C:\Fallout Modlist\Fallout Anomaly`. 🚨

For guidance on checking your system specs, refer to this [link](https://www.howtogeek.com/80108/how-to-get-detailed-information-about-your-pc-2/).

---

### Nexus Mods

While it's not mandatory, **Nexus Premium** is highly recommended as it streamlines the mod download and installation process. With Nexus Premium, you'll get uncapped download speeds and avoid manual approval for each download. This is due to restrictions on the Nexus website itself, not Fallout Anomaly.

  <summary><h2><ins>STEP 4: Known Issues & Controller Support.</ins></h2></summary>

## Main Menu Delay

When launching the game you may experience a delay as scripts load. This delay varies based on your system's power; more powerful systems may not encounter this issue.

## Stuck in Menu

If you find yourself unable to progress from the first loading or main menu:

**Watch this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTnhJsM3_hg&t) for help with the issue. If the video doesn’t resolve it, we’ve provided new save files for you to load and customize your character as needed.**  


## Post-Character Creation Freeze

After creating your character:
- Your game will save and may appear to freeze temporarily.
- This is due to multiple scripts loading simultaneously.
- Be patient and wait for a few minutes; the game will resume normally.

## Falling Through Vault Issue

If you're falling through the vault floor:
- This is likely due to the "Uneducated Shooter" mod.
- **Solution**: Only enable the "Uneducated Shooter" mod after leaving the vault.

## Known Crash Related Issues:

- Programs like medal (recording software) or anything that adds an overlay can conflict with the ENBS, or other DLL hooked mods. If you are crashing right at the launch of game or at the main menu this can be one of the main causes.


## **Controller Support** 🎮  

We currently support **PS5 controllers**, with **Xbox support planned for the future.**  

### **Step 1: Configure Steam Settings**  
- Ensure your **Steam controller settings** are correctly set up as shown in the window below.  
- **Steam Overlay** must be enabled for the controller to function properly.  
- **Steam Input**: Paste the following link into your browser and open Steam when prompted:  
  **steam://controllerconfig/377160/3417630938**  
  This will install the **custom controller profile** for Fallout Anomaly.  

### **Step 2: Enable the Controller Support Mod**  
- In **MO2**, activate the optional mod:  
  **"A - OPT - Controller Support - PS5 Support"**  

This ensures full functionality for your PS5 controller in-game. 🚀

  <summary><h2><ins>STEP 5: Essential Mods and Key Gameplay Mechanics</ins></h2></summary>



<details>
<summary><h2>1. Survival Mechanics: Immersive Hunting Overhaul (IHO)</h2></summary>

### Key Features
- **Advanced Food Mechanics**: Includes spoilage, disposal, blood sampling, salvaging, hunting, and trapping.
- **Camping System**: Lightweight yet effective camping mechanics.
- **Challenges and Achievements**: Unlock bonuses and items based on the IHO concept.
- **Cooking Overhaul**: Unlockable recipes and rebalanced food mechanics.
- **Customizable Experience**: Convenient MCM menu with numerous options to fine-tune gameplay.

---

### Carry Weight System

- Starting carry weight is lower than normal.
- **Carry Weight Formula**:
  - 1 STR = 85 Carry Weight (CW).
  - Each additional STR point provides +10 CW.
- **Robustness Skill**:
  - Increases carry weight as you level up, allowing more freedom to carry armor and junk.
- **Traits**:
  - Two traits can increase starting carry weight by +50 each but come with drawbacks for balance.

#### Backpacks
- Backpacks can be found or crafted using perks from the *Junk Jockey* skill.
- Backpacks provide an additional **100 CW capacity**.
- Use the "Open Backpack" aid item (found in the Aid section) to move items freely between inventory and backpack.

##### Known Bug & Fix:
- If your backpack disappears, respawn it using the "Commonwealth Backpacks Settings Holotape."
- Avoid spamming the backpack key to prevent this issue.

### Keybinding
1. Open your inventory and navigate to the **Aid** section.
2. Locate "Open Backpack."
3. Hover over it and press `Q` to bind it to a key (1–9).
4. Note: Only keys `1–9` work for keybindings.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>2. Skills and Levels</h2></summary>

- Utilizes the **[YAE mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/76739)**, which introduces new skills and modifies the perk system.
- Adds new traits for enhanced character customization.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>3. Combat Overhaul: SCOURGE</h2></summary>

### Overview
- SCOURGE overhauls NPC stats by using scripts to randomly generate values, creating realistic variations in NPC strength. This ensures that enemies are no longer predictable while addressing issues with Fallout's vanilla scaling system.

### Key Features
- Implements **normal distribution** for stat allocation (e.g., health, damage resistance).
- Highly customizable via MCM:
  - Adjust stats for specific NPC races.
  - Exclude specific NPCs or individual stats from being affected.
- Optimized scripting to prevent lag or bloat.

### Example
- Deathclaws now have randomized health between 500–900, with an average of ~700.
- Infinite variations mean there are over **12 million possible combinations** for Deathclaw stats alone.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>4. Better Locational Damage (BLD)</h2></summary>

- Equipment is what matters. Weapons/Modifications have been overhauled and you are now able to play a raider-style character with pipe weapons only. All weapons are lethal. Getting a good balanced armor rating is key to survive as health no longer scales with level. Use tactics and plan your actions when breaching rooms and areas.
Many new features, like stagger, bleeding, stealth killmoves, and more await to be used!

### Combat Mechanics

#### Enemy Categories
1. **Low Races**: Bloatfly, Bloodbug, Humans (no helmets), Ghouls (non-glowing), Radstags, Dogs.
2. **Medium Races**: Super Mutants, Mirelurks, helmeted Humans.
3. **High Races**: Yao Guai, Fog Crawlers, Anglers.
4. **Special Races**: Robots/Synths.

#### Headshot Mechanics
- Effectiveness varies by race and weapon caliber:
  - Low races can be killed with most weapons via headshots.
  - Medium races require higher-caliber weapons (.308, .50) or shotguns at close range.
  - High races are resistant to headshots; use explosives or tactics instead.

#### Pain System
- Introduces three pain levels: Minor, Moderate, Severe.
- Pain affects gameplay but can be treated with items like Med-X or alcohol.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>5. Deadeye Mod</ins></summary>

### Overview
- Deadeye is a headshot-focused mod that adds tactical depth to combat. Players can choose between one-shot kills, helmet protection mechanics, or head destruction mechanics.

### Race Categories
1. Weak: Easily killed by most weapons (e.g., Bloatfly, Human).
2. Moderate: Requires moderate-caliber weapons or shotguns at close range (e.g., Super Mutants).
3. Strong: Requires high-caliber weapons (.50 rounds) (e.g., Yao Guai).
4. Powerful: Immune to headshots by default but can be enabled via configuration (e.g., Deathclaws).

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>6. Munitions: Ammo Expansion Project</h2></summary>

- Munitions is a lore-friendly and modular ammunition expansion project & framework that adds new ballistic, energy, and explosive ammunition types seamlessly into the vanilla sandbox. Unlike other ammo frameworks, Munitions gives players control over what ammo they do or don't want added to their game. Features high-quality custom textures and meshes.

### Features
- Adds new ballistic, energy, and explosive ammunition types.
- Modular design allows players to control which ammo types are added to their game.
- Lore-friendly additions inspired by previous Fallout games.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>7. Radiation System & Healing</h2></summary>

### Mechanics
1. Introduces a dual radiation system:
   - **IRA (Ingested Radioactive Particles)**: Accumulated from food, water, weather hazards.
   - **RAD (Tissue Damage)**: Standard radiation damage from exposure.
2. Radiation poisoning mimics Acute Radiation Syndrome with progressive effects.
3. Weather-based radiation hazards require protective gear like gas masks or hazmat suits.

### New Items
- RadAway: Purges IRA and cures radiation poisoning.
- MutAway: Heals RADs directly.
- Rad-X: Increases IRA resistance.
- Pb-Jelly: Increases RAD resistance.


---

### Bleed System Overview

**Managing Bleeding**  
Stimpaks no longer work if you're experiencing internal or external bleeding. Before using a Stimpak, you must first mend your wounds.  

Bleeding is caused by bullets or bladed weapons and can be treated in two primary ways:  
- **Bandages**: Use these to stop the bleeding and close the wound.  
- **Bloodpacks**: These replenish blood but should be used sparingly—overuse can lead to cardiac arrest.  

---

**Healing Limbs**  
Stimpaks are no longer effective for healing limbs. Instead, you'll need specific medical items:  
- **Jerry-Rigged Medic Kits**: Temporary, painful solutions to stabilize limb injuries.  
- **Surgery Kits**: A more permanent fix, but they often leave open wounds, requiring bandages to stop the bleeding afterward.  

Healing is not instant, and the process can be painful. Always carry enough bandages when venturing into the Wastes.  

---

**Managing Pain**  
Pain from injuries can be treated with:  
- **Med-X**  
- **Painkillers**  

For persistent or severe pain, it's best to visit a doctor in a major settlement.  

---

**Treating Diseases**  
Each disease requires specific medication:  
- **Antibiotics**: Treat infections.  
- **Sleep Aid**: Cures insomnia. Note: Sleep aids are addictive, so use them in moderation.  
- **Anodyne**: Relieves fatigue.  
- **Anti-Parasitic**: Removes parasites.  
- **Stimulants**: Alleviate lethargy.  
- **Energy Pills**: Address weakness.  

Most of these medications can be found with doctors. If you're lucky, you might also find them on raiders, gunners, or other NPCs.  

---

**Final Tips**  
The Wastes are unforgiving, and every decision matters. Always carry enough medical supplies—bandages, painkillers, and specialized treatments—before heading out. Staying prepared can mean the difference between survival and death.

<summary><h2>8. Crafting System</ins></summary>

### Overview
Crafting has been expanded with additional requirements:
1. Perk-based crafting for specialized items (e.g., Dogmeat-related perks for Dogmeat items).
2. Higher-tier armors require advanced crafting perks and materials like ballistic weave.
