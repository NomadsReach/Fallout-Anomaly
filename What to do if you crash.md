    Due to how large of a mod list is and just how buggy Fallout 4 is in general we are bound to run into crashes, but thankfully we have some of the best modders to help us with these issues. If you run into a crash please follow the steps below. if it does not please open a ticket on the discord or here on the github under bug reports.

* Step 1: Open up Mod Organizer and click on Crash Report in the top right. Ensure the program looks just like the picture below.
